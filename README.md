This is a GUI editor app for the data in LiveSplit (.LSS) files. It is not quite finished.

You will find downloadable versions for Mac and Windows under the "Releases" button in the GitHub header.

# Using

Use the menu to open a .LSS file. It will list the basic file information, the times recorded for your PB and "best splits", and then all of your runs. Edit any field then save. **This is an early beta so I recommend backing up your .LSS before saving**.

If any of your runs did not finish, the table for that run will be missing rows at the end and there will be no final time listed. If any of your runs are missing split data (this happens if you renamed or reordered splits after recording the run) the missing splits will be labeled as "-----" and certain editing features will be disabled.

## TODO for 1.0

* In the final version there's gonna be an "Automatic" checkbox next to the PB and Best Splits listing for continuously recalculating your PB and best splits from the other data
* Open/save starts at system root every time :/

## Known problems

* No undo
* Can't remove a run
* If a run has fewer splits than it should you can't fix this
* If a run has splits which are "missing", rather than skipped (this happens when you rename/reorder splits when you already have runs) it can't usefully edit tht run
* Rounds to microsecond, this is what you want for LiveSplit One but for LiveSplit classic millisecond would be better
* If your split names are very long the times will get clipped on the right side of the window
* Changing the "offset" field doesn't change times (should it??)
* Open/save doesn't filter for .lss files
* File-modified tracking might be wrong
